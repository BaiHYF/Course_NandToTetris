        Control Signals:
            cAsrc -- 0: Ain from inst , 1: Ain from ALUresult -- inst[15]opcode
            cALUsrc -- 0: ALUin2 from inM, 1: ALUin2 from inst (immediate) --- inst[12]comp
            cAwr -- 0: don't write to A, 1: write to A --- inst[5]dest
            cDwr -- 0: don't write to D, 1: write to D --- inst[4]dest
            cALUop -- [6bits] --- inst[6..11]comp
            cMwr -- 0: don't write to M, 1: write to M --- inst[3]dest
            cPCload --- control by inst[0..2]jjj, zr, ng
